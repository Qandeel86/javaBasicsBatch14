		 * In Java we have || as the OR operator
		 * In Java we have ! as the NOT operator
		 * Why we should learn Logical Operators?
		 * 	-they help us reduce the number of if-conditions that we write in certain cases
		 * What is the syntax for these operators?
		 * 	-we write if-conditions that is either true or false 
		 * When to use AND operator?
		 * 	-when decision making all conditions must be true then use AND

		 * 	-similar to if else condition
		 * Why we should learn about the switch case?
		 * 	-its cleaner code
		 * 	-its faster than if conditions
